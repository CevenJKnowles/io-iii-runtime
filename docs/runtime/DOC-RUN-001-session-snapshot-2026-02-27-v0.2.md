# IO-III Runtime Session Snapshot  
Date: 2026-02-27  
Version: v0.2  
Status: Control Plane Stabilized

---

## 1. Current System Architecture

### Execution Chain
CLI → Config Loader → Deterministic Routing → Executor → (Optional) Audit Gate → Unified Output

### Active Structural Guarantees
- Deterministic routing (no self-routing)
- Single unified final output
- Challenger internal only
- One-pass audit maximum
- One-pass revision maximum
- No recursion loops
- No multi-pass runaway chains
- No autonomous self-expansion

---

## 2. Implemented Contracts

### ADR-008 — Challenger Enforcement
- Challenger runs only when `--audit` flag enabled
- Challenger cannot rewrite draft
- Challenger returns structured JSON only
- Fail-safe auto-pass if parsing fails

### ADR-009 — Audit Gate Contract v1.0
Hard enforcement at framework level:
- MAX_AUDIT_PASSES = 1
- MAX_REVISION_PASSES = 1
- RuntimeError if exceeded

Audit is:
- Evaluative only
- Non-recursive
- Non-routing
- No memory access
- No external tool invocation

---

## 3. Persona Injection (v0.1)

Lightweight executor identity contract:
- Static contract string
- Versioned (`persona_contract_version`)
- Injected into system prompt
- No routing influence
- Version returned in result.meta

Purpose:
Establish stable execution identity without adding behavioral autonomy.

---

## 4. Test Coverage

Current regression coverage:
- Audit runs at most once
- Revision runs at most once
- Challenger feedback never leaks into final output
- Persona contract version present in output

Scope:
Minimal tests guarding structural contracts only.

---

## 5. Architectural Boundaries (Frozen)

The following are NOT implemented:
- Persistent memory layer
- Verification module
- Auto-audit policies
- Steward Mode execution
- Multi-model arbitration
- Dynamic routing
- Retrieval systems

Expansion is gated behind governance.

---

# Next 5 Controlled Tasks (Proposed Order)

## Task 1 — Structured SessionState Object (Definition Only)
Create a formal runtime container for:
- request_id
- mode
- route
- execution metadata
- audit state
- persona version

No behavior change yet.
Foundation only.

---

## Task 2 — Extract Execution Orchestration from CLI
Move execution logic from `cli.py` into a core runtime module:
`io_iii/runtime/execution_engine.py`

Goal:
- CLI becomes thin I/O wrapper
- Runtime logic becomes testable core

---

## Task 3 — Memory Schema v0 (Design Document Only)
Define:
- allowed memory categories
- write policy (propose-and-approve)
- storage boundaries
No implementation.

---

## Task 4 — Declarative Model Role Registry
Formalize role → model binding in a static registry
Separate from routing table.

Goal:
Make role definitions explicit and versioned.

---

## Task 5 — Audit Policy Refinement (Later)
Evaluate:
- keeping toggle-only
- adding deterministic `--audit auto`
- optional intensity levels

Only after control plane extraction.

---

# Risk Assessment

Primary risk vector:
Control-plane sprawl via CLI-level expansion.

Mitigation:
Move orchestration into runtime core before adding new capabilities.

---

# Status Conclusion

IO-III v0.2 is now structurally disciplined.

Control plane stabilized.
Expansion readiness: high.
Autonomy level: intentionally constrained.

Further work must preserve:
Determinism.
Bounded execution.
Governance-first evolution.
