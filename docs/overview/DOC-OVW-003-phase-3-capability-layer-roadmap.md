# Phase 3 — Capability Layer Roadmap

---

## Purpose

Phase 3 introduces a **capability layer inside the execution engine** while preserving the architectural guarantees established in earlier phases.

The objective is **not feature expansion for its own sake**, but the introduction of carefully bounded capability interfaces that can support future runtime extensions without compromising:

* deterministic execution
* explicit governance boundaries
* invariant enforcement
* bounded audit behaviour

The capability layer must remain **engine-local and deterministic**.

---

## Architectural Context

The Phase-2 runtime architecture establishes the following execution structure:
```
CLI
↓
Engine.run()
↓
ExecutionContext
↓
Context Assembly (ADR-010)
↓
Provider
↓
Challenger (optional)
```
Phase 3 builds on this structure by introducing **internal capability boundaries inside the engine**, without modifying routing logic or the control-plane contract.

---

## Scope

Phase 3 focuses on:
* expanding engine-local capability interfaces
* strengthening dependency injection seams
* formalizing provider interaction contracts
* improving runtime extensibility without altering execution guarantees

The CLI, routing system, and control-plane governance rules remain unchanged.

---

## Non-Goals

The following capabilities remain **explicitly out of scope** for Phase 3:
* persistent memory systems
* retrieval or RAG pipelines
* autonomous planning or agent loops
* multi-model arbitration beyond deterministic routing
* streaming runtime execution
* automatic audit activation
* recursive reasoning chains

Future phases may introduce these capabilities only if they preserve the deterministic control plane.

---

## Planned Work Items

### 1. Provider Contract Hardening

Formalize the provider abstraction used by the execution engine.

Objectives:
* ensure deterministic provider interaction
* standardize provider method signatures
* enforce predictable input/output boundaries

Deliverables:
* provider interface documentation
* improved type annotations for provider adapters
* additional provider validation tests

### 2. Engine Capability Interfaces

Introduce explicit internal capability boundaries within the execution engine.

Examples of potential capability interfaces:
* execution pipeline stages
* capability flags for optional runtime features
* structured extension points for future modules

These interfaces must remain **engine-local** and must not introduce runtime autonomy.

### 3. Injection Seam Strengthening

Extend the existing dependency-injection seams introduced in Phase 2.

Current seams include:
* challenger injection
* provider factory injection

Phase 3 may introduce additional injection points where useful for:
* testing
* deterministic configuration
* runtime observability

### 4. Runtime Observability Improvements

Enhance runtime metadata exposure without logging content.

Potential additions:
* structured execution metadata
* expanded audit telemetry
* provider execution timing data

These improvements must remain compliant with the **content-safe logging policy**.

---

## Definition of Done

Phase 3 will be considered complete when:
* execution capability boundaries are clearly defined
* provider interfaces are documented and stable
* dependency injection seams remain deterministic
* routing behaviour remains unchanged
* audit gate bounds remain enforced
* invariant validation continues to pass
* regression tests remain green

Validation commands:
```
python -m pytest
python architecture/runtime/scripts/validate_invariants.py
```

---

## Relationship to Future Phases

The capability layer introduced in Phase 3 prepares the architecture for later system expansions while preserving the existing control-plane guarantees.

Potential future phases may explore:
* controlled memory persistence
* verification layers
* retrieval pipelines
* steward-mode orchestration

However, these expansions must continue to respect the core architectural constraints:
* deterministic routing
* bounded execution
* explicit audit control
* invariant-protected runtime behaviour

---

## Phase Summary

Phase 3 focuses on **structural extensibility without behavioural expansion**.

The architecture continues to prioritize **stability, determinism, and governance discipline** over rapid feature growth.
