# IO-III Session State — Phase 3 Hardening Complete

---

## Overview

This document records the current architectural state of the IO-III repository following the completion of Phase 3 and the subsequent hardening pass.

Phase 3 established the deterministic runtime foundation of IO-III.  
A short architecture hardening cycle was then performed to remove remaining structural seams and improve enforcement of runtime invariants.

The repository is now considered Phase-3 complete and hardened.

---

## Repository Version

```
Phase: Phase 3 — Runtime Foundation
Tag: v0.3.1
Branch: phase-iv
Status: Stable
```

Version meaning:
| Version | Meaning |
|------|------|
| v0.3.0 | Phase 3 completion milestone |
| v0.3.1 | Phase 3 hardening pass |

---

## Architecture Status

The IO-III runtime now provides the following architectural guarantees.

### Deterministic execution

- deterministic routing
- deterministic capability invocation
- no dynamic routing
- no autonomous planning

### Bounded execution

Execution limits defined in ADR-009:
```
MAX_AUDIT_PASSES = 1
MAX_REVISION_PASSES = 1
```

No recursion surfaces exist.

---

### Explicit capability invocation

Capabilities must be invoked explicitly.

Properties enforced:
- `max_calls = 1`
- bounded payload size
- bounded output size
- side effects disabled by default

Capabilities currently implemented:
```
cap.echo_json
cap.json_pretty
cap.validate_json_schema
```

---

### Content-safe observability

Runtime logs use content-safe metadata logging.

Forbidden fields:
```
prompt
completion
draft
revision
content
```

Allowed fields include:
```
prompt_hash
latency_ms
provider
model
route
capability metadata
audit metadata
```

All logging behaviour is verified via automated tests.

---

## Prompt Construction Discipline

All runtime prompts now pass through a single deterministic assembly boundary.

Execution pipeline:
```
persona_contract
        ↓
context_assembly
        ↓
provider execution
```

This applies to:
- executor prompts
- challenger prompts
- revision prompts

This change removes the final inline prompt construction seam that existed prior to the Phase-3 hardening pass.

---

## Hardening Changes Introduced

The following improvements were implemented during the hardening cycle.

### Session state enforcement

`validate_session_state()` is now invoked through the CLI execution path.

This ensures:
- early detection of invalid state
- strict runtime precondition enforcement

---

### Dependency declaration

A minimal `pyproject.toml` was introduced to declare runtime dependencies.

This improves:
- repository reproducibility
- professional packaging signal
- onboarding clarity

---

### Invariant test integration

The invariant validator previously run via a standalone script has been integrated into the test suite.

Now: `pytest` acts as a single command architecture verification pass.

---

### Routing determinism tests

A dedicated test now verifies deterministic routing behaviour.

Guarantee:
```
same inputs → identical routing decision
```

---

### ADR-010 seam removal

Previously, challenger prompts were assembled inline inside the runtime engine.

This has been corrected.

Challenger prompts now use: `CHALLENGER_PERSONA_CONTRACT` and pass through the context assembly layer.

This ensures all prompts follow identical assembly rules.

---

### Engine decomposition pass (v0.3.2)

- `engine.run()` decomposed into named sub-functions.
- The runtime kernel remains deterministic and bounded.
- `_replace()` aligned to `dataclasses.replace()` via a thin shim.

## Test Suite Status

```
Total tests: 38
Test modules: 17
Status: all passing
```

Coverage areas include:
- capability invocation
- routing determinism
- dependency injection
- audit gate enforcement
- metadata logging safety
- content-safety guards
- execution tracing
- invariant validation

---

## Architectural Verification Model

IO-III treats architectural guarantees as enforceable invariants rather than informal design intentions. The runtime therefore includes a structured verification layer composed of automated tests and invariant validation.

Public-facing verification is presented as a guarantee-to-verification mapping, while the underlying pytest suite contains the concrete implementation-level test cases.

| Architectural Guarantee | Verification Type | Coverage Area |
|---|---|---|
| Deterministic routing behaviour | unit / contract tests | routing determinism |
| Explicit capability invocation boundaries | behavioural tests | capability invocation |
| Dependency injection integrity | integration tests | provider dependency injection |
| Audit gate execution limits | contract tests | audit gate enforcement |
| Content-safe observability | safety tests | metadata logging safeguards |
| Execution trace integrity | behavioural tests | execution tracing |
| Runtime invariant enforcement | invariant validation | repository invariants |

Verification can be reproduced locally with:
bash
`pytest`
`python architecture/runtime/scripts/validate_invariants.py`

---

## Repository Health

Current evaluation:
| Category | Status |
|------|------|
| Architecture integrity | strong |
| Runtime safety | strong |
| Determinism | enforced |
| Governance documentation | strong |
| Test discipline | strong |

---

## Known Non-Goals

The IO-III runtime intentionally does not implement:
- agent behaviour
- tool planning
- recursive execution loops
- dynamic routing
- autonomous decision-making

The system is strictly a deterministic LLM runtime control plane.

---

## Next Phase

Next development stage:
```
Phase 4 — Post-Capability Architecture Layer
```

Phase 4 will introduce the architectural layer above capabilities while preserving IO-III invariants.

Key requirements:
- maintain deterministic execution
- preserve bounded runtime behaviour
- avoid agent architectures
- maintain content-safe logging
- keep capability invocation explicit

---

## Snapshot Purpose

This document serves as:
- the authoritative project checkpoint
- the handoff state for future sessions
- the starting point for Phase 4 architecture work
