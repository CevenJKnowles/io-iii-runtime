# IO-III Architecture Documentation Overview

This document provides the **navigation entry point** for the IO-III architecture documentation.

The documentation set follows a **structured document classification system**:

DOC-ARCH — Architecture definitions  
DOC-OVW — High-level system overviews  
DOC-IMPL — Implementation documentation  
DOC-RUN — Runtime configuration and behavior  
DOC-GOV — Governance and policy  

Each canonical document contains a YAML metadata header used for indexing and governance tracking.

# Overview Documents

| Document | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| DOC-OVW-001 | Architecture documentation index |
| DOC-OVW-002 | IO-III persona prompt behaviour overview |

# Relationship to Other Documentation Layers

## Architecture Layer

Defines the structural design and architectural guarantees.
```
docs/architecture/
```
Examples:
- execution model
- control-plane structure
- routing architecture

---

## Runtime Layer

Documents runtime behaviour and configuration.
```
docs/runtime/
```
Examples:
- routing table design
- provider configuration
- logging policy

**Runtime documents:**
- DOC-RUN-001 — Session snapshot (v0.2)
- DOC-RUN-002 — SessionState v0 contract
- DOC-RUN-003 — Metadata log schema (metadata.jsonl)
- DOC-RUN-005 — Execution trace schema (ExecutionResult.meta.trace)

**Architecture documents (selected):**
- DOC-ARCH-003 — Master project roadmap
- DOC-ARCH-004 — Runtime architecture
- DOC-ARCH-005 — Capability layer definition
- DOC-ARCH-006 — Execution observability (content-safe trace)
- DOC-ARCH-007 — Capability reference implementation
- *(DOC-ARCH-008 through DOC-ARCH-011 — not issued. These IDs were reserved during
  early Phase 3 planning and never assigned. No documents exist at these identifiers.
  The numbering resumes at DOC-ARCH-012.)*
- DOC-ARCH-012 — Phase 4 guide (Context Architecture Formalisation)
- DOC-ARCH-013 — Phase 5 guide (Runtime Observability & Optimisation)
- DOC-ARCH-014 — Phase 6 guide (Memory Architecture)
- DOC-ARCH-015 — Phase 7 guide (Open-Source Initialisation Layer)
- DOC-ARCH-016 — Phase 8 guide (Governed Dialogue Layer)
- DOC-ARCH-017 — Phase 9 guide (API & Integration Surface)
- DOC-ARCH-018 — Phase 10 guide (Public Release Preparation and Surface Extension)
- DOC-ARCH-019 — Phase 11 guide (Cloud Adapters, OpenAI Compatibility, and RAG Boundary) — stub

---

## Implementation Layer

Documents the reference implementation used by the architecture.
```
docs/implementation/
```
Examples:
- engine design
- execution pipeline
- dependency injection seams

---

## Governance Layer

Defines the governance rules and architectural change process.
```
docs/governance/
```
Examples:
- ADR process
- architecture review procedures
- invariant enforcement rules

---

# ADR System

Architectural decisions are documented in:
```
ADR/
```
The ADR system defines the **decision record for any structural change** affecting:
- control-plane behavior
- routing rules
- provider selection
- execution bounds
- memory or persistence layers

No structural architecture change should occur without a corresponding ADR.

---

# Architectural Principles

IO-III follows several core architectural principles:
- deterministic routing
- bounded execution
- invariant-protected architecture
- governance-first evolution
- local-first execution model

These principles ensure the system remains **predictable, inspectable, and stable** as capabilities expand.

---

# Documentation Navigation Strategy

The documentation is intentionally structured to support:
- architecture review
- onboarding for engineers
- external technical evaluation
- long-term maintainability

Canonical documents represent the **authoritative architecture description**.

Working notes and draft materials are stored separately and must not be mixed with canonical documents.

---

# Future Documentation Expansion

Future phases of IO-III may introduce additional documentation sections including:
- capability layer specifications
- verification architecture
- memory persistence contracts
- runtime orchestration strategies

These additions will follow the same document classification and metadata conventions.
