# IO-III Master Project Roadmap

## Purpose

This document defines the authoritative roadmap for IO-III development.

It consolidates:
- Deterministic runtime foundations
- Structural abstraction sequencing
- Governance boundaries
- Explicit non-goals
- Long-term architectural elevation constraints

This roadmap governs scope decisions.

---

# Phase 1 — Deterministic Core (Complete)

## Objectives

- Deterministic routing
- Provider resolution
- Challenger enforcement
- Audit gate with bounded passes
- Unified output surface
- Invariant validation
- Metadata logging policy
- Canonical documentation discipline
- YAML automation
- ADR sequencing discipline

## State

Stable.  
Frozen.  
No behavioural expansion.

---

# Phase 2 — Structural Consolidation (Current Phase)

## Objectives

1. Define `SessionState v0` (definition only).
2. Extract execution engine from CLI.
3. Implement Context Assembly Layer (ADR-010).
4. Freeze.

## Constraints

- No behavioural expansion.
- No memory systems.
- No retrieval.
- No arbitration.
- No autonomy.
- Determinism preserved.

## Deliverables

- `io_iii/runtime/session_state.py`
- `io_iii/runtime/engine.py`
- `io_iii/runtime/context_assembly.py`
- Structural tests (non-behavioural)

---

# Phase 3 — Envelope Sophistication (Deferred)

Only after Phase 2 freeze.

Potential work:

- Structured prompt envelopes
- Role registry abstraction
- Deterministic capability exposure
- Token estimation utilities (non-enforcing)
- Telemetry schema refinement

Still excluded:

- Persistent memory
- Retrieval systems
- Autonomous tool loops

---

# Phase 4 — Capability Expansion (Long-Term, Not Active)

Requires explicit ADR approval.

Possible future categories:

- Memory systems
- Tool registries
- Retrieval augmentation
- Multi-model arbitration
- Capability gating frameworks

This phase must never be entered implicitly.

---

# Governance Invariants

At all times IO-III must remain:

- Deterministic
- Bounded
- Auditable
- Non-autonomous
- Explicitly versioned
- Invariant-validated

No structural change without ADR.

No feature expansion without phase approval.

---

# Non-Goals (Active)

The following remain explicitly out of scope:

- Persistent memory implementation
- Retrieval systems
- Verification modules
- Auto-audit policies
- Dynamic routing
- Multi-model arbitration
- Autonomous meta-agents
- Recursive orchestration

---

# Evolution Model

IO-III evolves by:

Stability → Abstraction → Freeze → Expand

Never by uncontrolled feature accumulation.

---

# Review Discipline

Before introducing new architectural surfaces:

1. Check Phase alignment.
2. Check ADR coverage.
3. Check invariant impact.
4. Check determinism.
5. Check bounded execution.

If any of these fail, expansion is deferred.

---

# Summary

This roadmap formalises IO-III’s evolution discipline.

It protects architectural clarity, sequencing integrity, and governance-first design.

All future development must reference this document.
