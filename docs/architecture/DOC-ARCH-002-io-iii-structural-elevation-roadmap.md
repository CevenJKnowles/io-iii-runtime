# IO-III Structural Elevation Roadmap

## Purpose

This document defines the sequencing discipline for IO-III architectural evolution.

It prevents premature capability expansion and ensures governance-first progression.

This is a structural roadmap, not a feature roadmap.

---

## Current State (Phase 1 — Deterministic Core)

IO-III currently provides:

- Deterministic routing
- Provider resolution
- Optional bounded audit gate
- Unified output
- Invariant validation
- Metadata logging policy (content disabled)

Characteristics:

- No persistent memory
- No retrieval
- No autonomous orchestration
- No dynamic arbitration
- No multi-model reasoning loops

The system is structurally stable.

---

## Phase 2 — Structural Consolidation

Objectives:

1. Define `SessionState` v0 (definition only).
2. Extract execution engine from CLI.
3. Introduce Context Assembly Layer (ADR-010).

Constraints:

- No behavioural expansion.
- No new capability surfaces.
- No autonomy.
- Determinism preserved.

This phase introduces clean abstraction boundaries without expanding scope.

---

## Phase 3 — Envelope Sophistication (Deferred)

Only after Phase 2 freeze:

Potential future considerations:

- Structured prompt envelopes
- Role registry abstraction
- Deterministic capability exposure
- Token estimation utilities (non-enforcing)
- Expanded telemetry schema

Still excluded:

- Persistent memory
- Retrieval systems
- Autonomous loops

---

## Phase 4 — Post-Capability Architecture Layer (Active)

**Status: Active as of 2026-04-03. ADR-012 governs the bounded orchestration layer contract.**

Phase 4 introduces a bounded orchestration layer above the frozen runtime kernel.
It does not introduce memory systems, retrieval, or autonomous capability expansion
as originally deferred here. The scope is strictly bounded by ADR-012.

Governed surface:

- bounded orchestration (ADR-012)
- explicit task specifications (`TaskSpec`)
- deterministic failure model (ADR-013)
- bounded multi-step runbook layer (ADR-014, M4.7)

This phase must never expand beyond the ADR-012 contract without a new explicit ADR.

---

## Governance Principle

IO-III evolves by:

Stability → Abstraction → Freeze → Expand

Not by:

Feature Accumulation → Refactor → Complexity Inflation

Each phase requires:

- Clean test state
- Invariant validation
- Explicit ADR coverage
- Deterministic guarantees

---

## Explicit Non-Goals (Current)

The following are explicitly out of scope at present:

- Persistent memory implementation
- Retrieval systems
- Verification modules
- Auto-audit policies
- Dynamic routing
- Multi-model arbitration
- Autonomous meta-agents
- Recursive orchestration

---

## Summary

This roadmap formalises sequencing discipline.

It ensures IO-III remains:

- Deterministic
- Bounded
- Governance-first
- Structurally intelligible

Future architectural elevation must reference this document before introducing new surfaces.
