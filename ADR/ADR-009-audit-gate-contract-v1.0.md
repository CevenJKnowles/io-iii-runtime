# ADR-009 | Audit Gate Contract v1.0

- Status: ACCEPTED
- Date: 2026-02-27
- Version: 1.0
- Supersedes: None
- Related: ADR-008 (Executor + Challenger)

---

## Context

IO-III v0.2 implements a one-pass audit gate using a Challenger model to review Executor output.

The audit system is currently:
- CLI controlled (`--audit`)
- Single-pass
- Returning `audit_meta` in structured JSON
- Producing unified final output only

As the system expands, the audit gate becomes the primary structural hinge where recursion, drift, and control-plane sprawl could emerge.

This ADR freezes the audit contract to prevent architectural instability.

---

## Decision

The Audit Gate Contract is formally defined and frozen as follows:

### 1. Pass Limits (Hard Constraints)

- `max_audit_passes = 1`
- `max_revision_passes = 1`
- No additional chained review cycles allowed

These limits must be enforced at framework level, not by convention.

---

### 2. Audit Input Contract

Audit receives:
```
{\
prompt,\
executor\_output,\
constraints,\
policies\
}
```

Audit does NOT receive:
- Router configuration
- System state mutations
- Memory layer access
- Tool invocation permissions

---

### 3. Audit Output Contract

Audit must return:
```
{\
final\_output,\
audit\_meta\
}
```

Where:

- `final_output` = single user-facing output (unified)
- `audit_meta` = structured JSON (machine-readable)

No additional output streams are allowed.

---

### 4. Explicit Prohibitions

Audit is NOT permitted to:

- Trigger routing decisions
- Modify routing policies
- Invoke external tools
- Perform fact-verification calls
- Write to persistent memory
- Trigger additional audits
- Initiate recursive execution

Audit is strictly evaluative + bounded revision.

---

### 5. Determinism Requirement

Audit behavior must remain deterministic under identical inputs and policies.

No stochastic routing or multi-agent arbitration is allowed at this layer.

---

## Rationale

The audit gate is the only structural re-entry point in the execution pipeline.

Freezing its behavior:

- Prevents recursion loops
- Prevents runaway revision chains
- Preserves deterministic routing
- Stabilizes the control plane before expansion

This establishes IO-III as governance-first and expansion-ready.

---

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear architectural boundary
- Reduced drift risk
- Safer future integration of:
  - Memory layer
  - Persona injection
  - Fact verification module

### Trade-offs

- No multi-pass self-improvement cycles
- No dynamic adaptive arbitration at audit layer

These trade-offs are intentional for v0.x stabilization.

---

## Future Considerations (Not in Scope)

- Adjustable audit intensity levels
- Conditional auto-audit policy
- Verification gate module
- Steward-mode memory writes

These require separate ADRs.

---

## Status

Audit Gate Contract v1.0 is frozen.

Any modification requires a new ADR.
