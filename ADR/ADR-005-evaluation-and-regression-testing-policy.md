# ADR-005 — Evaluation and Regression Testing Policy

## Context

IO-III is a multi-mode, multi-model system whose quality depends on:
- deterministic routing (ADR-002),
- strict boundaries (ADR-004),
- observable behavior (ADR-003),
- stable persona behavior over time.

Because model outputs vary naturally, the repo requires a testing strategy that:
- detects **behavior drift** without demanding identical text,
- enforces **invariants** (routing, safety, formatting rules),
- supports **local-first** workflows.

## Decision

### 1) Two-layer evaluation: invariants + quality

IO-III evaluation is split into:

**Layer A — Invariant Regression Tests (must always pass)**
These tests assert rules that must not drift:
- routing selection and fallback triggers (ADR-002)
- cloud disablement / opt-in boundaries (ADR-004)
- logging defaults and retention configuration flags (ADR-003)
- “single-voice guarantee” (only one user-facing final output per cycle)
- role boundaries (e.g., Challenger is internal-only unless explicitly surfaced)

**Layer B — Quality Evaluation (monitored, not gatekeeping by default)**
These tests measure quality signals that may fluctuate:
- reasoning completeness
- factuality verification behavior (when required)
- structure adherence
- tone/verbosity discipline
- refusal correctness & safety compliance

Layer B produces metrics and notes; it does not block commits unless explicitly configured as a release gate.

### 2) Test outputs are scored, not matched

Regression tests must avoid exact string matching except where required.
Prefer:
- schema validation (YAML, JSON)
- section presence checks
- regex-based constraints (e.g., headings, required fields)
- routing log inspection
- “must include citations” checks where policy requires

### 3) Test corpus is versioned and minimal

Maintain a small, curated test corpus:
- representative prompts per mode
- edge cases for safety + routing
- doc-generation prompts for YAML compliance

Add new tests when:
- a bug is found (test reproduces it),
- a policy is added (ADR introduces new invariant),
- a drift event occurs (lock in prevention).

### 4) Challenger as evaluator, not author

Challenger mode is designated as the primary evaluator:
- generates critiques, scores, and failure reasons
- does not directly publish user-facing responses
- feeds Synthesizer/Executor for final output

This preserves governance boundaries: evaluation ≠ delivery.

### 5) Gating policy (simple and enforceable)

- **Pre-commit / CI gate:** Layer A (invariants) only
- **Release gate (optional):** Layer A + selected Layer B thresholds

Default for solo work:
- gate only Layer A
- review Layer B periodically (weekly or per milestone)

## Decision Drivers

- Multi-model systems drift; invariants must remain stable.
- Quality varies; policies should detect degradation without blocking iteration.
- Portfolio-grade engineering favors explicit tests and traceable behavior.

## Options Considered

### A) Exact-output snapshot testing
Rejected:
- brittle under model variability,
- produces noise,
- discourages iteration.

### B) No testing; rely on manual review
Rejected:
- increases drift risk,
- lowers confidence in ADR guarantees,
- not portfolio-grade.

### C) Invariant gating + quality monitoring (selected)
Accepted:
- stable guarantees,
- realistic under LLM variability,
- scalable as the repo grows.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Fast iteration without sacrificing core guarantees.
- Clear separation between “must not drift” and “should improve”.
- Tests become living documentation of system behavior.

### Trade-offs

- Requires deliberate selection of invariants.
- Some subjective quality regressions may slip through between reviews.
- Maintaining a corpus takes discipline (but stays small by design).

## Implementation Notes (Non-normative)

Recommended structure (paths are suggestions, not mandated yet):
- Test cases: `./IO-III/tests/corpus/`
- Invariant tests: `./IO-III/tests/invariants/`
- Quality eval scripts: `./IO-III/tests/quality/`
- Results/logs (local-only): `./IO-III/runtime/logs/` (per ADR-003)

Recommended minimum invariant tests:
- ADR-002 routing table validation (mode → primary/secondary)
- fallback trigger simulation (timeout, 5xx, not found)
- cloud disabled unless explicit enable flag set
- “internal audience cannot route to cloud” check
- metadata logging schema presence
